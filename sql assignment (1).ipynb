    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - A database is a structured collection of data is designed to efficiently store , retrive, manage information , databases are used to organize and store data in a way that allow for easy access , retrieval and manipulation of the data. They play a crucial role in many application and system, including website , business software and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL- SQL databases are based on a relational model, which means they use tables to store data, data is organized into rows and column and relationship between different datas entities are maintained through forign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are tradiionaly vertically scalable which means you can increase their capacity by adding more CPU RAM or storage to a single server . they may be less suited for handling high traffic loads or big data \n",
    "\n",
    "SQl databases are well suited for application where data integrity  and complex quering are important such as financial system , e-commerce platforms , and traditional relational data scenarios \n",
    "\n",
    "- NOSQL \n",
    "\n",
    "NOSQL databases do not use fixed schema and are more flexible in how they store data. They can use various data models including document-oriented(eg. Mongodb ) \n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL datsbases oftem offer eventualy consistensy which means data may not always be immediately consistent across all nodes in distributed system. The trade off is often for better avaiblity ans partition tolerance \n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are often used in scenarios where flexiblity , scalablity , and speed are critical such as real time big application , content management system and iot application "
